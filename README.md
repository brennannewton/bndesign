### Humantiy X Technology
Created with React, Node, Visual Studio Code, & Vectary.

Inspired by video game aesthetic, this website aims to explore the meaning of UX (User eXperience) while serving as an archive for my work. The user is supposed to feel like they're in a video game or a VR (Virtual Reality) simulation. The goal is to create a sense of depth, which allows the application to take up space.

####Concept
Desgin webspace to feel hospitable. Hompages should make the user feel welcome; colors, textures, and lighting should create a friendly atosphere; and navigation tools should encourage exploration. 

####Tools
- __Vectary__ is a CMS (Content Management System) for 3D and AR (Augmented Reality) content. I'll use this to create 3D models and embed them into my website. These will create an envrionment in which the user can exist while using the site.
- __React__ is a JavaScript libary for building user interfaces. It organizes HTML elements into components, providing a framework for both code and design.
- __Atomic Design__ by Brad Frost is a mental model that organizes design elements into a hierarchy. Frost describes this hierarchy, "as both a cohesive whole and collection of parts _at the same time_," which allows designers to quickly shift between abstract and concrete modes of thinking.
