### Humantiy X Technology
Created with React, Node, Visual Studio Code, & Vectary.

This website serves as an archive for my work and creates an emotionally engaging user experience (UX).

#### Concept
Design webspace to feel hospitable. Hompages should make the user feel welcome; colors, textures, and lighting should create a friendly atmosphere; and navigation tools should encourage exploration. These design choices aim to make the website feel like home with the hope that the user feels more comfortable in the space.

#### Tools
- __Vectary__ is a CMS (Content Management System) for 3D and AR (Augmented Reality) content. I'll use this to create 3D models and embed them into my website. These will give the space depth.
- __React__ is a JavaScript libary for building user interfaces. It organizes HTML elements into components, providing a framework for both code and design.
- __Atomic Design__ by Brad Frost is a mental model that organizes design elements into a hierarchy. Frost describes this hierarchy, "as both a cohesive whole and collection of parts _at the same time_." This model allows designers to quickly shift between abstract and concrete modes of thinking.

#### Open Source
This project is open source.
